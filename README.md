Front End Technologies Week 5 Coding Assignment - Tic Tac Toe

Create a game of tic-tac-toe:
    a.	A heading should say whether it is X’s or O’s turn and change with each move made.
    b.	Create a tic-tac-toe grid using your HTML element of choice. When a cell in the grid is clicked, an X or O should appear in that spot depending on whose turn it is.
    c.	A button should be available to clear the grid and restart the game.
    d.	When a player has won, or the board is full and the game results in a draw, a Bootstrap banner should appear across the screen announcing the winner.
